# wcagUI - Making Accessibility... Accessible - Code of Conduct

**last updated 31 July 2025**

> *Accessibility is a human right. Every contribution to **wcagUI** starts from this belief.*
>
> This document is inspired by widely‑adopted Codes of Conduct in the open‑source world, including the [Contributor Covenant v2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), the Rust, Kubernetes, and Django community guidelines.

## Our Commitment

We, as maintainers and contributors of **wcagUI**, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Our work centers on **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)**. We therefore hold ourselves to an even higher bar of empathy and inclusion: *software that excludes is broken*.

---

## Expected Behavior

* **Inclusive & Accessible** - Design, code, and discuss with the goal of removing barriers for all users.
* **Respectful Communication** - Use welcoming and inclusive language. Accept constructive criticism and offer it in kind.
* **Empathy** - Consider the impact of your words and actions on people with different backgrounds and abilities.
* **Collaboration** - Foster a supportive environment: pair programming, mentoring, and knowledge sharing are encouraged.
* **Transparency** - Document decisions and cite sources when appropriate.

---

## Unacceptable Behavior

* Use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention.
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* Public or private harassment, including ableist, sexist, racist, homophobic, or transphobic remarks.
* Publishing others’ private information (doxing) without explicit permission.
* Deliberately ignoring or undermining WCAG or best accessibility practices.
* Any conduct which could reasonably be considered harassment.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all wcagUI spaces—GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, discussions, chat platforms (Slack, Discord, etc.), social media, and both online or in‑person events—**as well as when an individual is officially representing the project** (e.g., in public talks).

---

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

---

## Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it as soon as possible:

**Private GitHub issue** labeled `code‑of‑conduct` (visible to maintainers only), **or**

   * A clear description of the incident
   * Links, screenshots, or other supporting evidence (if available)
   * Date and time in UTC
   * Your contact information for follow‑up (optional)

We will respond as soon as possible (mostly **five (7) business days**) and keep all reports confidential.

---

## Enforcement Process

1. **Acknowledgement** - We confirm receipt of the report.
2. **Investigation** - Additional information may be requested from the reporter and/or the reported.
3. **Decision** - Maintain­ers determine appropriate action: warning, content removal, temporary suspension, or permanent ban.
4. **Communication** - Outcome is communicated to relevant parties while respecting privacy.
5. **Documentation** - Incidents are logged in a private repository.

---

## Possible Actions

* **Apology** (public or private)
* **Formal Warning**
* **Removal** of content violating this Code
* **Temporary Ban** from community spaces
* **Permanent Ban** for severe or repeat offenses

---

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant v2.1 and incorporates guidance from the Django, Rust, and Kubernetes communities to align with wcagUI’s accessibility‑first mission.

*An accessible and inclusive community is a stronger community. Thank you for helping us build it!*
