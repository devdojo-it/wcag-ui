# wcagUI, crafting UIs with Accessibility built-in!

## Making A11y... Accessible

Welcome to wcagUI - where accessibility is seamlessly woven into every line of code. Designed with developers in mind, wcagUI empowers you to build stunning, inclusive interfaces with ease. Here‚Äôs what can make wcagUI your choice:

- **Zero External Dependencies** üì¶: Crafted in pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, wcagUI is entirely self-contained, ensuring a lightweight, straightforward integration without the overhead of bulky libraries.
- **Semantic HTML at Its Core** üìú: Every component is built with semantic HTML, so your UI communicates clear meaning to browsers and assistive technologies‚Äîboosting both accessibility and SEO.
- **Accessibile by Design** ü§ñ: based on [WCAG Patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns) and featuring mostly automatic WAI-ARIA attribute handling, wcagUI makes it effortless to create interfaces that are inclusive and robust.
- **Cutting-Edge Web APIs** üöÄ: Leverage the power of the latest core web technologies; wcagUI harnesses state-of-the-art HTML, CSS, and JavaScript APIs for fast, modern, and future-proof interfaces.

Focus on crafting amazing user experiences while wcagUI takes care of making every interface accessible to everyone. Welcome to a world where inclusive design is truly effortless! üåç‚ú®
