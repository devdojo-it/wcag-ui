# Creating a new Component
TODO: create a node.js script CLI for making the following process automatic

## Process for creating a new component

0. copy and paste the `./scripts/templates/component` folder into the `./packages/components`
1. rename the `component` folder in `./packages/components` with your actual componentName (eg. `tooltip`)
2. find and replace the `componentName` with your actual componentName (eg. `tooltip`), make sure to activate the "AB" button in the replace form
3. rename the `componentName(.*).[js|css]` files with your actual componentName (eg. `tooltip`)
4. add the new component dependency in main `package.json` file (eg. `@wcag-ui/tooltip`: `workspace:^0.0.0`)
5. run `pnpm install` command
6. for working on the component or just use it add the following code lines
  - `@import "npm:@wcag-ui/tooltip/tooltip.min.css"` in your main css file (eg. `./src/styles/index.css`);
  - `import '@wcag-ui/tooltip';` in your main js file (eg. `./src/scripts/index.js`);
  - it's needed to add the specific component HTML code to make it run
7. now your component is ready to work on or to be tested
