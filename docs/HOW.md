# How wcagUI Works

At its core, wcagUI is built on modern, native web technologies that empower developers to create accessible interfaces without unnecessary complexity. Here’s how we achieve this:

### Custom Elements without Shadow DOM

- **Native Integration:** We use customElements to define our components while deliberately avoiding shadow DOM or other encapsulation techniques, preserving the natural flow of semantic HTML.
- **Transparent DOM Structure:** Without shadow DOM, every element is part of the global DOM, making inspection and debugging straightforward with standard development tools.
- **Enhanced SEO & Accessibility:** Exposing all elements ensures that search engines and assistive technologies can properly index and interpret your content.
- **Simplified Debugging:** Developers benefit from a clear, DOM structure with no-encapsulation streamlines troubleshooting and performance optimization.
- **Easier Integration:** The absence of encapsulation allows for seamless integration with other libraries and tools, fostering a more flexible development environment.

### Dynamic Interactions with Custom Events

- **Seamless Communication:** Custom events facilitate effortless interaction between components, ensuring a smooth flow of information throughout your application.
- **Decoupled Architecture:** Using custom events promotes modularity, allowing components to remain independent and maintainable.
- **Flexible Event Handling:** Developers can create, dispatch, and listen for events tailored to the specific needs of their applications.
- **Enhanced Maintainability:** The event-driven model simplifies tracking and debugging interactions, making ongoing maintenance more manageable.
- **Customizable Lifecycles:** Tailor event lifecycles to suit dynamic user interactions, enabling advanced event delegation and responsiveness.

### Efficient Initialization with Static Blocks and JS Mixins

- **Static Initialization Blocks:** These blocks handle component setup as soon as they’re defined, ensuring that each component is ready for action immediately.
- **Consistent Component Setup:** By initializing components predictably, we minimize runtime errors and provide a stable foundation for your UI.
- **JavaScript Mixins for Reusability:** Mixins allow you to extend or customize component behavior without duplicating code, fostering a modular approach.
- **Reusable and Extendable Code:** With mixins, common functionalities are abstracted into easily reusable modules that simplify ongoing development.
- **Predictable Execution Order:** Static initialization ensures a well-defined order of operations, reducing unexpected behavior during runtime.

### Modular Styling with CSS Custom Properties and @layer

- **Custom Properties for Theming:** Leverage CSS custom properties to offer flexible theming and styling options, allowing for easy customization of your UI.
- **Dynamic and Contextual Styling:** Adjust styles in real-time based on context or user preferences, enhancing the overall user experience.
- **Organized in @layer:** Custom properties are organized within dedicated CSS layers, ensuring clear separation of concerns and a predictable cascade.
- **Scoped Styling Layers:** Using @layer prevents style conflicts in larger projects, maintaining a clean and maintainable style architecture.
- **Performance Optimized:** Layering reduces the complexity of style recalculations, leading to faster rendering and improved performance.

By fusing these advanced techniques—customElements without shadow DOM, dynamic custom events, static initialization blocks with JS mixins, and modular CSS organized in @layer—wcagUI provides a robust, future-proof toolkit. This framework simplifies the development process while guaranteeing that every interface you build is accessible by design.
