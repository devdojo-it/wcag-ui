# Why wcagUI?

In today’s digital world, accessibility is too often overlooked or underestimated. Companies,
designers, and developers frequently dismiss it as an "extra service" or something that can be
addressed later—perhaps even patched with a quick overlay—rather than recognizing it as a core
aspect of design. This mindset excludes a significant portion of users. According to the World
Health Organization, around 1.3 billion people—roughly 16-20% of the global
population—experience barriers when accessing digital content. Ignoring these needs isn’t just
a missed opportunity; it’s a disservice that affects millions.

At wcagUI, we believe that accessibility must be an integral part of the development process,
not an afterthought. Our toolkit empowers developers to embed accessible design directly into
their code using semantic HTML, strict adherence to WCAG patterns, mostly automatic WAI-ARIA
handling, and cutting-edge web APIs. The goal is simple: to make it effortless for developers
to build inclusive interfaces that truly serve everyone.

By shifting the focus from viewing accessibility as an optional add-on to recognizing it as a
fundamental right, wcagUI aims to transform the digital landscape—one interface at a time.
Join us in creating a web that leaves no one behind.
